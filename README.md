# Plato-s-Pizza-Sales-Analysis

**Overview**
This dataset provides a year's worth of sales from Plato's pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients. The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis to gain insights into its operations, customer base, and overall performance. The analysis will involve collecting data, conducting a thorough examination, and providing actionable recommendations based on the findings. The project aims to help the pizza place make informed decisions and improve its business strategies.



**Objective questions**
 What days and times do we tend to be busiest? 
 How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
 What are our best and worst selling pizzas?

**Conclusion**

1.Pizza sales peak at 12 p.m. -2 p.m.  Thus no employee should be allowed to be absent at that time period, unless emergencies, to cover up the rising orders.

2. Remove pizzas with size XL and XXL from the menu since they account for only 1.7% of total sales. This can help to streamline the menu and simplify the operations.

3. Include more variety in the Classic pizza category.
